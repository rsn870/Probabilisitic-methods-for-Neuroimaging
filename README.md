# Probabilisitic-methods-for-Neuroimaging
Source codes + notebooks for tracking project progress on applying Variational/ Probabilistic methods for Neuroimaging.

Code includes tutorials / small scale trial runs in Google colab which may be useful in a general sense.

Code uses pytorch for DL + Pyro for probabilistic inferencing. All codes are GPU run using CUDA Backend
