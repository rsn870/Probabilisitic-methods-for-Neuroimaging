# Probabilisitic-methods-for-Neuroimaging
Source codes + notebooks for tracking project progress on applying Variational/ Probabilistic methods for Neuroimaging.

Code includes tutorials / small scale trial runs in Notebooks (run code in google colab for getting full results) which may be useful in a general sense.

Code uses pytorch for DL + Pyro for probabilistic inferencing. All codes are GPU run using CUDA Backend 

Currently we consider 3 basic frameworks of VAE - Vanilla , Beta and VQ. For application to 3D MRI Images we later reconstruct these using 3D convolutions.
